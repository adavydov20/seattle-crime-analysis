# Seattle Crime Analysis & Forecasting

This project explores historical crime data in Seattle and applies time series forecasting to predict future crime trends. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to identify patterns and make data-driven inferences about crime rates.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze crime trends in Seattle and forecast future incidents.
- **Dataset**: Seattle crime data spanning January 2019 â€“ May 2025.
- **Key Skills**: Data wrangling, visualization, time series modeling, and forecasting.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Prophet)
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Git/GitHub for version control

## Analysis Highlights

- Breakdown of crime by type, location, and month
- Year-over-year comparisons to uncover trends
- Visualizations of seasonal and cyclical patterns
- Time series modeling to predict future crime rates
